# JercyProjectMaster
👩‍💻👨‍💻 Make your project settings even easier

When using swiftlint and cocoapods, beginners will have difficulty.
So I created the JercyProjectMaster, which is easier to use with the UI.

### Use it
#### Download app
https://github.com/JeaSungLEE/JercyProjectMaster/releases/download/1.1/JercyProjectMaster.app.zip

Unzip and launch the app.
When you run the app, you will see a screen where you can select a project location.
You must select the iOS project folder. (Make sure there is xcodeproj in that folder.)

JercyProjectMaster has two functions.
swiftlint, and cocoapods.

#### Swiftlint

Press the swiftlint button to see the above screen.
Check the name and description and check the lint you want to use.
The checks that are set by default refer to 
[swiftlint's Ruels.md](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md).
